Description: Utility functions for working with datasets gathered using
    'Open Data Kit' ('ODK') <https://opendatakit.org/>. These include an API to 
    interface with 'ODK Briefcase', a 'Java' application for fetching and pushing 
    'ODK' forms and their contents, that allows pulling of data from either a remote 
    'ODK Aggregate Server' or a local 'ODK' folder, a rename function to give more 
    human readable variable names for 'ODK' datasets, a merge function to create 
    a single dataframe from a nested 'ODK' dataset and an expand function to 
    disaggregate multiple choice answers that have been collapsed into single code 
    by 'ODK'.
